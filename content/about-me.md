**![Cover About Me](/imgs/cover_about_me.jpg#center)**

**CloudNative** represents everything that’s currently in my focus, and I’m currently working as a **Technical Lead** at [**Engineering**](https://www.eng.it/), with a strong focus on **Kubernetes** and **architectural design**.  

I’m passionate about **energy optimization** and **performance**.

**Let’s go back in time:**  

Raised on **bread and Thoreau**, I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to confront only the essential facts of life, and discovered that **no matter how many frameworks you know, algorithms and data structures will always come first.**

I turned on my first computer at age **8**, and since then, I’ve never turned off the verbose flag on the **Linux kernel** in favor of some sleek rotating spinner – I need to **understand what’s happening under the hood, constantly**.

Things took a turn in **1999** when I watched **The Matrix** for the first time in my room with my brother.

I started coding in **Python** at **12**. **TCP/IP** and **OSI** came after, earning me the nickname **“Router”** in high school.

From **Systems Specialist** to **System Administrator**, I decided that path was not truly mine: **I love coding and always have**. 

I’ve worked with **Python**, **C**, **Rust**, **Go**, **Scala**, **JavaScript**, **Lua**, and **Java** – which I **deeply love**.

I **deeply despise technological fanaticism**, and use the languages that best suit each situation.

A strong supporter of **open-source** and an active participant in several communities, without which **I’d be nothing**.

In my free time, I **climb mountains**, **run**, **code**, and **read**.  
Often, I do all of these on the **same day**.
