**![Annapurna](/imgs/annapurna-e1702371937873.png)**

What you see in the photo is me, **8,000 km away from home**, on one of the highest mountains in the world, smiling and happy that this won’t be my last night alive.

## 💡 A Near-Death Realization

10 minutes before capturing this image, I was in tears, desperately on the phone with **Anita**, the call center assistant from my health insurance.

> *"Andrea, you won’t die on Annapurna, the diagnosis rules out appendicitis; you have a muscular issue near your abdomen."*

Reading through several **NDEs** (*near-death experiences*), people in those moments encounter visions of loved ones, a world without wars, or even a four-day workweek—like reaching nirvana.

But my thoughts? Far less serene:

> *"My wallets, my passwords, my encrypted disks, my will written at 13…my entire digital identity lost forever."*

## 🛠️ Birth of Casper

This existential crisis led me to create **Casper**—my **digital alter ego** designed to securely distribute my digital identity to my heirs (**who don’t even know they are heirs**).

For **security reasons**, I won’t dive into the technical implementations but will discuss the challenges Casper must overcome to fulfill its role after I cease to exist.

---

## 💀 Are You Alive?

Casper must periodically verify if I’m still alive. Since no technology is infallible, it uses **redundant and diverse strategies**, including:
- **Robocalls**, **push notifications**, **SMS**, **email**.
- **Sensors** (medical devices included).

**Key Considerations**:
1. **Redundancy**: Signals must be sent repeatedly if there’s no response.
2. **Resilience**: If I’m out climbing **Nanga Parbat**, Casper shouldn’t assume I’m dead.

Only after **multiple attempts** and checks does Casper declare me deceased and distribute my identity **as planned**.

---

## 🌍 Redundancy

Casper must be **distributed globally** to ensure resilience. This includes:
- **Multiple instances** worldwide.
- At least one **self-controlled instance** (hardware included) to mitigate cloud-specific disasters.

**Complete redundancy** requires planning for:
- **Power sources**.
- **Data lines**.
- **Hardware failures**.

---

## 🔒 Security

**Casper is a courier**, not an inspector. It must:
- Use **end-to-end encryption**.
- Rely on **secure hardware** for keys, such as [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/?segment=INDIVIDUAL).

---

## ✅ Test, Test, Test

Everything related to Casper should:
1. Be **open source**.
2. Be **stable** and **extensively tested**.
3. Undergo rigorous **security checks** using tools like **SonarQube** or **Kiwan**.

---

## 💣 Self-Destruct in 3…2…1

Casper must include a **self-destruct mechanism** to irreversibly erase data across all instances if tampering is suspected.

---

## 🛠️ Maintenance

Casper isn’t a **"set it and forget it"** project. It requires:
- **Periodic reviews**, from the kernel level to user space.
- Continuous updates to adapt to **technological evolution**.

---

## 👼🏼 Was It Necessary?

**Absolutely NOT.** 😄

While there are safer ways to safeguard one’s digital legacy, Casper was a deeply personal project, driven by my fascination with solving seemingly **insurmountable technological challenges**.

---

## Final Thoughts

To this day, **Casper ensures I’m alive**—and hopefully, it has sparked your curiosity as much as it did mine. 🙂
